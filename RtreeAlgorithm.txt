every leaf kontains between m and M records unles it is root

for each index record (obdelnik I, identifikator mnoziny - tuple identifier)
in leaf node, I is the smallest rectangle, that spatially contains
the n-dimensional data object represented by a tuple

every non leaf node has between m and M children unles it is a root

For each entery (I, child node / child pointer) in a non-leaf node,
I is the smallest rectangle, that spatialy contains the rectangles in
child node.

The root node has at least two children, unless it is a leaf at the same
time

all leaves appear on the same level

Alg. Search:
Given tree whose root node is T find all index records whose rectangles
overlap a search rectangle S

Search subtree - If T is not a leaf, check each entery E to determine
whether or not overlaps S (search rectangle). Invoke search on each entery
with overlaping recangle.

If T is a leaf, check all enteries to determine wether or not overlaps S.
If so E is qulifying record.

Alg. Insertion
Inserting  index records ifor new data tuples is similar to B-tree in that
new index records
